# Benfords-Law-and-Russell-2000
To discover and use Benfords Law in the Russell 2000 index

The goal of this project is to pull the prices of all the securities in the Russell 2000 index daily for an extended peroid of time.

A visual graphic will be used to examine the trends of leading digit 9 priced securities each day to see what behavioural patterns emerge.

Markchov chains will be used to examine the transitional probabilities of these securities to see if Benfords law influences leading digits 9 securities to have a higher probability of increasing in price. 

Basically, do securities with a leading digit 9 price have a greater probability of increasing in price than the other leading digits.
